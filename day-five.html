    <h2>Why do we need key in react ?</h2>
    <p> Ans-A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements in React. Keys are used in React to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted. <br /> In other words, we can say that keys are used to give an identity to the elements in the lists. The next thing that comes to mind is that what should be good to be chosen as key for the items in lists. <br/> It is recommended to use a string as a key that uniquely identifies the items in the list</p>

<h2>What is use of Usecallback and UseMemo</h2>
 <p> A.useCallback: The useCallback is a react hook that returns a memoized callback when passed a function and a list of dependencies as parameters. It’s very useful when a component is passing a callback to its child component to prevent the rendering of the child component. It only changes the callback when one of its dependencies gets changed. <br />
     B.useMemo: The useMemo is similar to useCallback hook as it accepts a function and a list of dependencies but it returns the memoized value returned by the passed function. It recalculated the value only when one of its dependencies change. It is useful to avoid expensive calculations on every render when the returned value is not going to change.</p>
