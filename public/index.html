    <h2>1- What is the Difference between react and react native? Which one is library or framework?</h2>
        React and React Native are developed by Facebook. React is known as ReactJs, which is a JavaScript library to build single-page web applications.Besides, React Native is a React JS-based framework to design mobile apps. Moreover, with reusable components, you can develop native mobile applications. 
        React is a JavaScript library of reusable components designed to create skeletons of the apps, whereas React Native is designed to build native mobile apps with reusable components. React is an open-source JS library for building the UIs for web applications; besides, React Native is used to build rich mobile UI from declarative components using only JavaScript. Both React and React Native are ruling the industry and are widely used for mobile and web applications. However, the difference between web apps vs websites will not affect your user.
        React is an open source JavaScript framework, that isn't actually a framework. But it is currently the most commonly used front-end development technology in the world. React, originally developed by and still maintained by Facebook and supported by an active open source community, is in fact a JS 'library'. React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android. It's based on React, Facebook's JavaScript library for building user interfaces, but instead of targeting the browser, it targets mobile platforms.

    <h2>Que-3 What is lazy loading in react ? </h2>
    Lazy loading refers to loading something only when itâ€™s required by making requests dynamically. In React.js it is used to import components and associated resources only when they need to be rendered. The goal of lazy loading is to get faster intitial load times.

    <h2>Que-4 Difference b/w Stateful and stateless Component</h2>
    <h4>Stateless-</h4>
    <p>If the behaviour is independent of its state then it can be a stateless component. You can use either a function or a class for creating stateless components. But unless we need to use a lifecycle hook in your components, we should go for function components. There are a lot of benefits if you decide to use function components here; they are easy to write, understand, and test, a little faster, and you can avoid the this keyword altogether.</p>
    <h4>Stateful-</h4>
    <p>If the behaviour of a component is dependent on the state of the component then it can be termed as stateful component. These stateful components are always class components and have a state that gets initialized in the constructor</p>
    <p>Hooks let us use state and other React features without writing classes. The Equivalent Functional Component import React, {useState} from 'react';</p>
